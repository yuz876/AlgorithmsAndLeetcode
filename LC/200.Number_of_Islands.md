200. Number of Islands

Medium

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

```python
offsets = [(0,+1), (+1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1)] 
class Solution:
    
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return -1
        
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islandCounter = 0
        visited = set()
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == "1" and (i, j) not in visited:
                    self.bfs(grid, i, j, visited)
                    islandCounter += 1
        return islandCounter
        
    def bfs(self, grid, i, j, visited):
        myqueue = collections.deque()
        myqueue.append((i, j))
        visited.add((i, j))
        
        while myqueue:
            currPosition = myqueue.popleft()
            curr_x = currPosition[0]
            curr_y = currPosition[1]
            for offset in offsets:
                neighbor_x = curr_x + offset[0]
                neighbor_y = curr_y + offset[1]
                if 0 <= neighbor_x <= len(grid) - 1 and 0 <= neighbor_y <= len(grid[0]) - 1:
                    if grid[neighbor_x][neighbor_y] == "1" and (neighbor_x, neighbor_y) not in visited:
                        myqueue.append((neighbor_x, neighbor_y))
                        visited.add((neighbor_x, neighbor_y))
               
```
