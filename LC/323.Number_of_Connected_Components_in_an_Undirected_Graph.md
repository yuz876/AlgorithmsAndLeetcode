323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected 
     Graph
     
Medium

You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2000
1 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai <= bi < n
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.

class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not edges:
            return n

        for edge in edges:
            node2Neighbors[edge[0]].append(edge[1])

        for node in node2Neighbors:
            if node not in visited:
                self.bfs(node, visited, node2Neighbors)
                connectedComponentsCounter += 1
        if len(visited) < n:
            return n - len(visited) + connectedComponentsCounter
